## Homework

### Dataset

In this homework, we will use the California Housing Prices from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices).

Here's a wget-able [link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexeygrigorev/datasets/master/housing.csv):

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexeygrigorev/datasets/master/housing.csv
```

The goal of this homework is to create a regression model for predicting housing prices (column `'median_house_value'`).
